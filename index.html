            <p class="bio-text"> 
                My journey into coding began at Flatiron School where I completed a course for front-end and back-end web development. 
                There I used programs such as Vanilla Javascript, Python, HTML, CSS and then on to more advanced software
                such as React, Flask, SQL, SQLA, and Bootstrap UI to create functional websites. I am a Chef. I have 
                worked in and managed many kitchens such as: Benihana, Steubens, Bartaco, and Puttery. Whether it be creating delicious meals,
                or innovative websites, I strive to employ my skills and creativity to create quality products for people.  </p>
